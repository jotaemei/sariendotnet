# Sarien.net #
Sarien.net is a browser-based interpreter for adventure games published by [Sierra On-Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment) in the 1980's. These games involve titles such as Leisure Suit Larry, Space Quest and Police Quest.

The game engine used by Sierra was called AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter) and was reverse engineered by the [Sarien](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sarien) project. The name Sarien was an abbreviation for Sierra AGI Resource Interpreter Engine. This project has recently merged into [ScummVM](http://scummvm.org).

The Sarien.net javascript interpeter was written from scratch using my personal blunt axe approach, and uses ported bits of the original Sarien interpreter where my axe was too blunt. It was based on the original documentation by Peter Kelly.

Its goal is not to create an exact replica of the original engine, but to offer fun-focused tribute to these games, as well as adding webbased features such as hackable urls, cross-platform/browser coverage (including Wii and IPhone) and multiplayer as seen in its prequel project at www.goodoldadventures.com.

Sarien.net was written by [Martin Kool](http://martinkool.com) of [Q42](http://q42.nl).

It uses the [open source Q42 Multiplayer engine](http://code.google.com/p/q42multiplayer) to allow players to see and interact with eachother during gameplay.
